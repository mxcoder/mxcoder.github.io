            <h2>My current opinions</h2>
            <p>The world is a mess, politics are shit, democracy is at peril, economy is tough, capitalism is thriving, war is hell.</p>
            <p>And still, I fight back, not as a virtue signal, but as a true burning desire to feel alive.</p>
            <p>As days go by, I try to <a href="https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night">rage</a>, and enrage others.</p>
            <p>The best think you can do with your time is spend it with others.</p>
            <p>Talk to others, in real life if possible, at least video call your loved ones, at least once per week, listen to what they do and feel.</p>
            <p>Nobody has all the answers, nobody will. You must find your own ways and coping mechanism. Let others help you.</p>

            <p>I have gone through massive changes in how I live and let live.</p>
            <p>Before my 20s I was pretty much uninterested in the outside world, which I guess its a sort of healthy childhood.</p>
            <p>I spent too much energy in my 20s trying to (according to me) educate others on politics, science, religion, values.</p>
            <p>Also in my late 20s and early 30s as disillusion kicked in, I spent too much time caring about work.</p>
