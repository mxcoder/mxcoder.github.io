        <p>And these are my opinions on Nationality.</p>

            <h2>My current opinions.</h2>
            <p>I have a love / hate relationship with Mexico, this does not make me unique in any way.</p>
            <p>Germany is awesome but with caveats.</p>
            <p>I consider myself a global citizen, I hope to live in a few more places in the world over my lifetime.</p>
            <p>Forced migration is something horrible that noone should ever endure, most of them are heroes.</p>
            <p>Elective migration is awesome, something everyone should consider and try.</p>
        
            <h3>On Mexico.</h3>
            <p>Mexicans can be great. Mexicans can be awful.</p>
            <p>Mexico as a place, is such a beautiful country completely wasted by our politics and social values.</p>
        
            <h3>On Germany.</h3>
            <p>Extremely safe. Sometimes to a boring extreme.</p>
            <p>Natives are like coconuts. Hard on the outside. Hard on the inside but you can acquire the taste and enjoy them.</p>
            <p>They have issues when it comes to be pragmatic.</p>
            <p>They need help, but they are very proud.</p>
        
            <h3>On the "first world".</h3>
            <p>The "first world" is safe and stable. That's the key differentiatior and why so many of us go there.</p>
            <p>USA should not be classified as "first world".</p>
            <p>Only countries with sensible social policies, like healthcare, transportation, taxation, etc. should be classified as such.</p>

            <h2>Archive of opinions</h2>
            <p>The first world is superior in all ways to most countries.</p>
