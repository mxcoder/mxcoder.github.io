            <h2>Life is more than work, but work can be good.</h2>
            <p>Earlier in my life I spent too much time working for the sake of money or recognition.</p>
            <p>Later in my life I'm fortunate enough to focus on different reasons to work.</p>
            <h3>The people.</h3>
            <p>I have found joy in helping others. Building with others. Succeeding and failing with others.</p>
            <p>Being a good colleague, developing professional, friendly and even close relationships with coworkers has given me so much joy.</p>
            <h3>The craft, the path.</h3>
            <p>I'm one of the luckiest persons in the planet having found a <a href="./../my-career.html">good career</a> in something I enjoy a lot.</p>
            <p>Being suspect of having some sort of ADHD, my brain requires heavy doses of stimulus, learning and mastering things works it out.</p>
            <p>The rush of solving a complex problem, the rush of reflecting on the process, the thrill to improve it.</p>
            <p>The boredom of just maintenance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Work can be awful.</h2>
            <p>Lack of agency is burnout. Burnout is hell.</p>
            <p>One single bad leader/manager, poisons the well, for everyone.</p>
            <p>There is just too much BS in our industry.</p>
            <p>Capitalism could be better, but VC and other forms of burning money are just evil forms of capitalism.</p>
            <p>Some days I wish fads like VC-driven tech crashes down and all of them lose their money.</p>
            <p>Specially for fads like Crypto and "AI".</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Work could be better.</h2>
            <p>Focus on people: customers, colleagues, workers.</p>
            <p>Focus on learning and solving real current problems.</p>
            <p>Fight back and use tech for good. Use the leverage of tech workers for good, while we still have some.</p>
