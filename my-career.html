            <h2>On Software Development</h2>
            <p>I have no bachelor degree, I dropped out because I was a very lousy student back then, maybe I still am.</p>
            <p>Although I did 2 years of an Engineering degree, including maths, programming, structures, databases and electronics.</p>
            <p>I'm a very good autodidact, learning on my own way has proven to be very successful, for me and others.</p>
            <p>I truly enjoy solving the puzzle. Getting that kick of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I have wear many hats in my life from Web generalist, JS expert, Python engineer, MLE, Data Engineer, Team lead, Manager.</p>
            <p>I have worked in small shops, museums, startups, medium sized tech (not on Big Tech so far).</p>
            <p><strong>I'm a pragmatic. Perfect is the enemy of Done.</strong></p>
            <h3>Current Tech</h3>
            <p>Nowadays I'm a hands-on Data Analytics Team Lead/Manager.</p>
            <p>I really enjoy exploring, managing and visualizing data, mostly using SQL but also Python.</p>
            <p>I work with Google Cloud Platform, I really like how easy to use are services like BigQuery, BigQueryML, CloudRun and GCS.</p>
            <p>I also work with a diverse arrange of buzzworded tech like: Kafka, Terraform, Protobuf, GenAI, etc.</p>
            <h3>Known Tech</h3>
            <p>Initially I adored the visual nature of the Web tech, I'm was forged by LAMP..</p>
            <p>To this day I like from time to time to "hack" things up with PHP and JavaScript</p>
            <p>But I'm not expert of "modern web development": frameworks on both sides might be useful, but bring me no joy.</p>
            <p>I think I know my way around Vanilla JS, the DOM, the BOM, etc.</p>
            <p>I can code on PHP, NodeJS and Python. A bit of Java and Go and Rust.</p>
            <p>I don't enjoy Java, Kotlin is tempting but I haven't had the chance.</p>
            <p>I <strong>&lt;3</strong> Linux, the terminal, Bash, Make, Git, anything that helps me automate the mundane.</p>
            <p><small>I don't care much about hardcore Linux distributions, simple and functional is better.</small></p>
            <p>I know my way around Cloud Services, AWS and Google are on my resume.</p>
